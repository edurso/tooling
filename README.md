# Tooling Configuration for Ubuntu Machines

## Installation

On a clean installation of Ubuntu server, proceed as follows.

1. Set up [GitHub SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. Download [`install.sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edurso/tooling/master/install.sh)
3. Run `chmod +x install.sh`
4. Run `sudo ./install.sh` (takes the flags `-d` for desktop, and `-p` for personal configurations)
